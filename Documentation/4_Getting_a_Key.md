# Getting a Key
---

Krnl is a free-to-use program, but the developers need some sort of credit for it.
Krnl requires you to go through 5 Linkvertise Checkpoints before getting your key.
This helps monetize Krnl and supports the developers.

Head over to <https://cdn.krnl.ca/getkey.php> to start.
Complete the tasks that you are given and soon you'll have a key! (this should take less than 5 minutes)
Your key will last 24 hours, after it expires you'll have to repeat this process.

## Using Your Key

Open Roblox and inject Krnl with the Inject button.
A console should appear and your key will automatically be checked.
After the console closes, Krnl should be injected!
