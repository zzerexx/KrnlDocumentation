# User Interface
---

The Krnl interface is fairly simple to use.
This is the current UI as of May 26, 2021.

Let's get started at the top left corner.

***

## Tabs

### File

The File tab has two options, Inject and Kill Roblox.
These two buttons are self-explanatory.

### Credits

The Credits tab reveals a new part of the UI.
It lists all the people that have contributed to Krnl!

### Games

The Games tab is currently not in use.

### Hot-Scripts

Hot Scripts is basically the script hub of Krnl.
There are 7 different scripts to use. You can use these for developing or to have fun.

### Others

This tab contains other stuff, such as the Key site and the Discord server.

Now, let's look below the tabs. The Script Editor!

***

## Script Editor

This is where you put your scripts to execute. The editor is not very good compared to other exploits, but it gets the job done.
Above the editor, we have Script Tabs. You can have multiple scripts at once in different tabs, and even rename them by right-clicking on the tab. Click the plus icon next to the tab to create a new tab!

We have reached the bottom of the UI, the buttons!

***

## Buttons

There are 6 different buttons to use, each one has a different use.

### Execute

Executes the code in your script editor.

### Clear

Clears the script editor.

### Open File

Open files directly instead of copy and pasting.

### Save File

Easily save scripts in a .lua file.

### Inject

Injects Krnl.

### Options

Reveals a new part of the UI where there are 5 different settings to toggle.

*   Auto Attach - Automatically attaches Krnl when you open Roblox.

*   Top Most - Keeps Krnl on top of other applications.

*   Opacity Fade-in/out - Makes Krnl transparent when you are not using it.

*   Remove Crash Logs - Removes the crash logs.

*   Toggle Monaco - Allows you to use custom backgrounds on your script editor.

And now the final part of the UI, the script box.

***

## Script Box

The script box contains your personal scripts.
You can easily load or execute scripts directly from the UI!
Putting scripts here is easy. Just put your script in a .txt or .lua file and drag it into the scripts folder.
Right-click on the box, click on Refresh and your script will show up!

# Beta User Interface

There is currently a new beta interface that you can use, it still has some bugs but looks pretty cool!
You can find this on <https://krnl.ca>!

Let's get started on the top left corner, the Home button.

## Home Page

### Recent

You can find your recent scripts here (in case you accidentally deleted your tab!).

### Scripts

These are the scripts that are within your Scripts folder.
You can access this folder by going to `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Krnl\Scripts`

### Community

This section is basically the script hub. There's currently only Bruh Hub and CMD-X.

Below the Home button, there's another button that has the new Krnl logo on it.

## Dropdown Menu

## Preferences

You can find a couple of settings in the Preferences tab.
